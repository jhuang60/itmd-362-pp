# Production Problem 04: Implementing HCI Guidelines for Touchscreens

## The Problem

Using the HCI guidelines from either Apple/iOS, Android/Google, or Windows, redesign the login page at
http://my.iit.edu/ for a touch-friendly environment. Use this to kickstart your work on Project 2.

**You only need to sketch your redesign**, and in the text below, reference at least three different
points of guidance from chosen HCI guidelines that went into your redesign sketches (you might
want to do multiple sketches, each highlighting a different feature of the same overall design).
Focus on touch-related elements.

## Resources

* Apple iOS HCI Guidlines:
  https://developer.apple.com/ios/human-interface-guidelines/overview/design-principles/
* Android:
  https://developer.android.com/design/index.html
* Windows Desktop Guidelines:

## Deliverables

Small commits to your Production Problems repository that include:

1) photographs of sketches of your new design, from your sketchbook
2) an explanation of three different points of guidance from your chosen guidelines (point to the
   specific URL where the guidance can be found) that you implemented in your sketch, written below:

* HCI Guidline One (URL):https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/dn742449.aspx
* How you implemented it in your sketch: improving the user experience by getting rid of all extra information that the user will ignore. This will allow the user to quickly find the input boxes to login.

* HCI Guidline Two (URL):https://material.io/guidelines/components/bottom-navigation.html#
* How you implemented it in your sketch: getting rid of unnecessary components like the clear button that the user will very unlikely to use. Only keeping what is necessary for a login screen, for example username and password inputs, forgot username/password, and login button, to keep everything simple. 

* HCI Guidline Three (URL):https://developer.apple.com/ios/human-interface-guidelines/overview/themes/
* How you implemented it in your sketch: modify the size of text and logo images to appropriately fit the screen, and expand input boxes for better experience in small touch screens. This is necessary since the iit website's mobile scale has its input boxes for login very small and it needs the user to enlarge the screen in order to enter information on the login.
