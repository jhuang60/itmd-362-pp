## ITMD 362, Production Problem 03: Color Palettes

For this production problem, you’re going to create several custom color palettes on the site
Paletton, http://paletton.com.

Choose a palette based on each prompt, and paste the Paletton URL in with your chosen palette
(you’ll see that the uid value in the Paletton URL changes with each adjustment that you make).
Write a few sentences explaining why you chose the colors you did.

1. A monochromatic color palette for a site introducing a new console gaming platform

Your Palette URL:  http://paletton.com/palette.php?uid=13w0u0kl7r6ef6l697cs3SgmRVy
Your Rationale: I picked a dark grey color for the background and a slightly gray blue to highlight
things like menu banner and some headers because dark backgrounds and and blue are used for many gaming
related websites such as playstation official website, and steam. These two colors together provides a
futuristic feel.

2. An adjacent color palette for announcing springtime tours at the Chicago Botanical Gardens

Your Palette URL: http://paletton.com/palette.php?uid=52J0x0kl7DY%2B%2BqX%2B%2BqX00R000R0
Your Rationale: In my opinion green, white, and blue are good options that remind people of
spring and having lighter colors helps the website to get a brighter feel.

3. A triadic color palette for styling the login page for an app for kids to learn the alphabet

Your Palette URL: http://paletton.com/palette.php?uid=33r140kpG%2B%2B0mPx0mPxpG%2B%2BpG%2B%2B
Your Rationale: Bright colors remind people of children playgrounds and bright and more concentrated colors
are used on a lot of children products/toys.

4. A custom color palette for advertising a course on cybersecurity

Your Palette URL: http://paletton.com/palette.php?uid=a3I0U1ktbUp%2B%2Boc%2B%2Boc02Fo02Fok00ko0X8O0X8O00y600y6
Your Rationale: Blue and grey reminds me of anything related to technology and security.
